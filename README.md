 Simple games with python

This is my first attempt to publish my newly gained python skills presented via simple games on to github.I'd like to thank Python Engineer from [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbXgNpp0jedKWcQiULLbDTA]for the video-guide!
The games are:
**Guess the number**; simple numbers game.
**Rock,paper,scissors**; the classic.
**Wordle**,simple word guessing game.
**Connect Four**; try to connect your 4 tokens against a friend.
**Tic tac toe**; another classic game against computer.
